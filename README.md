Feedforward Neural Network with Backpropagation



-The DL_Final_A1.pynb is the pyhton notebook where each question is solved and implementation is present. 

-To run the script with these default parameters, you can use:

python train.py --wandb_entity myname --wandb_project myprojectname

-The script will train the neural network on the Fashion MNIST dataset (by default) and log the results to Weights & Biases.
